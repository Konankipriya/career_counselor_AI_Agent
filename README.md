The problem Statement:
Youth in rural areas often lack access to structured career guidance due to limited exposure,
absence of professional counselors, and poor awareness of skill development opportunities. Many students are unaware of job-oriented courses, government schemes, or online training
platforms that could help them build a career aligned with their interests. Traditional methods of career counseling are not scalable and fail to reach underserved
communities, contributing to skill mismatch, underemployment, and loss of potential. There is a strong need for a smart, localized, and accessible solution that can provide
personalized career guidance to rural youth based on real-time, trusted information.

The technologies that i have used for this project:
IBM cloud lite services,
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG),
IBM Granite model.


services:
IBM Cloud Watsonx,
IBM Cloud Watsonx AI runtime,
IBM Cloud Agent Lab,
IBM Granite foundation model.

process:
login into the ibm cloud and open the watsonx from the Menu.then click on watsonx.ai then there will be Gen AI solutions, from that open Automating tasj=ks AI Agent.
From there open Agent Lab(beta). in that description we can see watsonx.ai home page ,open it.
now we have to create project and add cloud object from ibm services.
then we have to associate watsonx.ai run time services.
then we have to build AI Agent. then we have to give some quick questions to the agent and also the common instructions and agent instructions to give responsens clearly to the users.
